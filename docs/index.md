# Data Rights Roundtable by Consumer Reports & MIT Media Lab

The Data Rights Roundtable, hosted by Consumer Reports and MIT Media Lab is an event focused on exploring how to better execute consumer data rights under CCPA. [Register here](https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7).

Event attendees will preview and comment on a draft technical specification of a Data Rights Protocol (DRP). This specification defines a web protocol encoding a set of standardized request/response data flows such that End-Users can exercise Personal Data Rights provided under regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act and other regulatory or voluntary bases, and receive affirmative responses in standardized formats.

The program will highlight the progress of DRP implementers and provide a forum where data rights stakeholders can pose feedback, questions, and ideas on the Data Rights Protocol and its potential future directions. Topics include:

* What is the Data Rights Protocol
* The Role of Authorized Agents and DSR Providers
* Issues and Options for Consumer Verification

>> You can register here: [https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7](https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7)

DRP’s first implementers are Consumer Reports Digital Lab, DataGrail, Ethyca, OneTrust, Spokeo, Surfshark, and Transcend.
