# Data Rights Public Working Group by Consumer Reports & MIT Media Lab

The Data Rights Working Group hosted by Consumer Reports and MIT Media Lab is an event focused on exploring how to better execute consumer data rights under CCPA. [Register here](https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7).

Event attendees will preview and comment on a draft technical specification of a Data Rights Protocol (DRP). This specification defines a web protocol encoding a set of standardized request/response data flows such that End-Users can exercise Personal Data Rights provided under regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act and other regulatory or voluntary bases, and receive affirmative responses in standardized formats.

The program will highlight the progress of DRP implementers and provide a forum where data rights stakeholders can pose feedback, questions, and ideas on the Data Rights Protocol and its potential future directions. Topics include:

* What is the Data Rights Protocol
* The Role of Authorized Agents and DSR Providers
* Issues and Options for Consumer Verification

>> You can register here: [https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7](https://forms.gle/xJifpswrddxXNbhs7)

DRP’s first implementers are Consumer Reports Digital Lab, DataGrail, Ethyca, OneTrust, Spokeo, Surfshark, and Transcend.

# Data Rights Protocol

* README: [DataRightsProtocol.org](http://datarightsprotocol.org)
* Data Rights Protocol Version 0.2: [https://github.com/consumer-reports-digital-lab/data-rights-protocol/blob/main/DRP-V02.md](https://github.com/consumer-reports-digital-lab/data-rights-protocol/blob/main/DRP-V02.md)

**Version 0.2 of the Data Rights Protocol is intended as an intial draft.  We expect to post an updated version in early October 2021 based on a collaborative drafting effort among a multistakeholder group and to present and discuss the direction of this emerging protocol at the Data Rights Working Group event hosted by MIT on October 19th, 2021.**

## Introduction

This specification defines a web protocol encoding a set of standardized request/response data flows such that End-Users can exercise Personal Data Rights provided under regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act, General Data Protection Regulation, and other regulatory or voluntary bases, and receive affirmative responses in standardized formats.

We aim to make the data rights protocol integrable with an ecosystem of data rights middlewares, agent services, automation tool kits, and privacy-respecting businesses which empower and build trust with consumers while driving the cost of compliance towards zero.

## Motivation

Data Rights are increasingly becoming universal, but the method of request and protocol for communicating those requests varies and there is no universal interchange format. Companies operating under these regulatory regimes face not only technical challenges in collecting and delivering responses to users’ data rights requests but also face significant process burdens as consumers increasingly make use of these rights. At the same time, consumers find it tough to execute their data rights under new privacy laws, partially due to a lack of standardization among companies.

By providing a shared protocol and vocabulary for expressing these data rights, we aim to minimize the administrative burdens on consumers and businesses while providing a basis of trust for verifiable identity attestation which can be used by (individual) consumers (or by an agent intermediating the relationship on behalf of consumers) and businesses.
