The Data Rights Interface Protocol, fully realized, would cover each key functional rights request authorized under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including:

* The so-called "right to opt-out" (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.120(a));
* The so-called "right to delete"  (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.105(a)) subject to denial for certain statutory business reasons (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.105(d)); and 
* The so-called "right to know" what personal information a business has, including the categories of third parties purchasing or receiving their data and the specific pieces of personal information held (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100, 1798.110, 1798.115, and 1798.130; (Cal. Code Regs tit. 11, §§ 999.313(c) and 999.318).

The interface specified by the protocol focuses on the data exchange, including requests, replies, and ticket tracking, between Consumers and Businesses, including intermediation by an Authorized Agent acting on behalf of the Consumer and by a DSAR Provider acting on behalf of the business.
