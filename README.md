* Data Rights Protocol Version 0.1: [https://github.com/dazzaji/data-rights-protocol/blob/main/DRP-V01.md](https://github.com/dazzaji/data-rights-protocol/blob/main/DRP-V01.md)

**Version 0.1 is intended solely as a conversation starter.  We expect to post an updated version in early October 2021 based on a collaborative drafting effort among a multistakeholder group and to present and discuss the direction of this emerging protocol at the Data Rights Summit hosted by MIT on October 19th, 2021.  Information about and a link to register to attend the Data Rights Summit will be posted here in late September, 2021.**

## Introduction

This specification defines a web protocol encoding a set of standardized request/response data flows such that End-Users can exercise Personal Data Rights provided under regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act, General Data Protection Regulation, and other regulatory or voluntary bases, and receive affirmative responses in standardized formats.

We aim to make the data rights protocol integrable with an ecosystem of data rights middlewares, agent services, automation tool kits, and privacy-respecting businesses which empower and build trust with consumers while driving the cost of compliance towards zero.

## Motivation

Data Rights are increasingly becoming universal, but the method of request and protocol for communicating those requests varies and there is no universal interchange format. Companies operating under these regulatory regimes face not only technical challenges in collecting and delivering responses to usersâ€™ data rights requests but also face significant process burdens as consumers increasingly make use of these rights. At the same time, consumers find it tough to execute their data rights under new privacy laws, partially due to a lack of standardization among companies.

By providing a shared protocol and vocabulary for expressing these data rights, we aim to minimize the administrative burdens on consumers and businesses while providing a basis of trust for verifiable identity attestation which can be used by (individual) consumers (or by an agent intermediating the relationship on behalf of consumers) and businesses.
